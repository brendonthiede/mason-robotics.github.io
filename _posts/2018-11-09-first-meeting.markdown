Our team, made up of Alaiedon 3rd and 4th graders, had our first meeting this week. We started by going over the [FIRST Core Values](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll/core-values) and then discussed the components of an official FLL event: Core Values, Project, and Robot Design. We also talked about some of the specific challenges in the Robot Game for Into Orbit. It ended up being roughly 20 minutes of discussion, 30 minutes of the kids just going crazy with LEGO inventions, and then 10 minutes of clean up and debrief. The plan for next week is to have parents watch the video linked below for a good explanation of the challenges for the Robot Game and then we'll start going through the Engineering Notebook and practice filling that out, and as time permits, go over some of the ideas for project inspiration on the FIRST LEGO League Blog.
