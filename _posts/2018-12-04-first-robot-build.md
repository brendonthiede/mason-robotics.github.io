At our latest meeting we built a small bot together. It was for testing some of our motors. We made the bot say "Hello" and "Noah". Then we talked about the scoring rubrics for the judges, talked about some more of our project ideas, and we started building our motors for our final robot. We'll see you after our next meeting.
