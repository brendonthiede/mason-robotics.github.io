Tonight's practice had the team rebuilding some broken challenge modules and then working out the program for completing mission 11, "Escape Velocity" [(see page 27 of the Challenge Guide)](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2019/FIRST-FLL-2018-19-ChallengeGuide-Letter.pdf).

Here's a video of a practice run that was a little off, but pretty close (they actually nailed it quite consistently): [https://photos.app.goo.gl/gM4MmpTiXXHrfAL4A](https://photos.app.goo.gl/gM4MmpTiXXHrfAL4A)

Just a few more weeks, where the team will try to polish their project and pick what other challenges they're going to try for the final event.
