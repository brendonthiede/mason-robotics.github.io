For last night's meeting we talked about what we needed to do for the project presentation. We also talked about what challenges we wanted our robot to do. For the project, we decided to have an example of our idea for plants in space and to have a poster and a skit. Over spring break some of the team is going to work on each part of the project.

There are six practices left to finish our project and programming.
