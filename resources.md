### FIRST LEGO League (FLL)

FIRST LEGO League is an alliance between FIRST & the LEGO Group. FLL teams research a real-world problem such as food safety, recycling, energy, etc., and are challenged to develop a solution. They also must design, build, program a robot using LEGO MINDSTORMSÂ® technology, then compete on a table-top playing field.
